# Tom's C Rendering Library
TCRLib <s>is<s> will be a multi-purpose rendering library, mainly for the C programming language. Currently 
it is in it's infancy, but will consist of a multitude of features once complete.

Currently it is a heavy WIP. Although some of the main features it will include are:
- MacOS/Linux/Windows support (Currently only MacOS).
- Cocoa/Metal/OpenGL/Vulkan support (Currently Cocoa).
- Applications will be platform independant (Although there maybe some caveats to this).
- UI Library, featuring standard controls across all platforms.
- Math library for graphically intensive rendering, featuring SIMD functions.
- Utilities for platform interaction.
